## About Charm Consulting Ltd

Charm Consulting provides ASP.NET software engineering and consulting services
on a contract basis.

## About Me (Tim Abell)

I provide programming  and consultancy services for clients with primarily C# /
ASP.NET MVC projects. I focus on providing quality long-term solutions to the
problems at hand, making sure the work being done is aligned with the
priorities and values of the client. I have full-stack web development
capabilities, with an emphasis on back-end systems. I can lead, mentor and can
communicate with all stakeholders.

My core values in my work are: honesty, continual learning, applying best
practices, quality, elegance, practicality, avoiding dogmatism, emergent
architecture, YAGNI, agility, customer focus, continuous process & code
improvement.

I’ve focussed on software engineering roles & projects since graduating in 2000
with a degree in Cybernetics & Control Engineering from Reading University.
I’ve had the opportunity work in organisations of all sizes which has allowed
me to gain broad knowledge and skills, from team leadership to server
administration.

As the tech industry never stands still I've recently been broadening my
skillset by adding GoLang to my existing full-stack C# / ASP.NET web
development skills. My latest side-project (written in GoLang) is
[SQL Schema Explorer](https://timabell.github.io/schema-explorer/), this has been helping me improve my marketing skills
as well as broadening my programming skills.

I have a broad interest in programming and business and am always doing
something beyond client work.
