<p>This weekend went extremely well.<br>Friday night me and Mr T had an excellent curry at the <a href="http://www.readingrestaurants.com/Haweli/">Hawelli</a>, shame no one else came but it was good anyway,  hospitality was excellent as usual, and Juggy was down there, which was nice.<br>Saturday morning = sleep. Got up in time to go outside and get hailed on. (ow,  ow ow ow, ouch!). Then I cycled into Reading and bought some new shoes (-:   (pwetty dress - <a href="http://www.weebl.jolt.co.uk/shoes.htm">[context]</a>).<br>Karaoke at the local - yay, much drunkenness.</p>
<p>Today, pub lunch with folks. A quick jog in the new shoes, then more sleep.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Joel &amp; Ritu:<br>See <a href="http://www.jmansford.f2s.com/Jai/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.photobox.co.uk/public/detail.html?c_album=612927">this</a>.<br>Utterly adoreable.<br>(I work with Joel, for those who don't know)</p>
