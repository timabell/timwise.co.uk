<p>So, I went to the pub last night with my neighbour, which was nice. And we went on our bikes, which was nice. And we had a couple of drinks, which was nice. And we went outside to go home, and it was pouring with rain, which was interesting. So we got soaked.</p>
<p>Going to an MSDN evening later. Bit of professional development.</p>
<p>On another topic, it occurs to me that the standard practice in Microsoft.NET is to write software that only runs with MSSQL, this means there is starting to be a lot of code available that won't run on anything else. I imagine there are potential optimisations from writing specifically for ms sql, but I can't help thinking that it is a typical ms vendor lock in. Whether it was a conscious decision to make this the default or not I couldn't say and don't really care, the end result is the same. Take a look on codeproject and see how many projects say "only runs with ms sql".</p>
