<p>Life is good.<br>I'm far too busy to write anything interesting in my journal so instead here's the possibly sexist joke that fluffy sent me last week.</p>
<p>Made me laugh anyway. Well I had had quite a few drinks and it was about 1am.</p>
<p>==============</p>
<p>We always hear "the rules" from the female side. Now here are the rules</p>
<p>from the male side.</p>
<p>These are our rules:</p>
<p>Please note... these are all numbered "1" ON PURPOSE!</p>
<p>1. Breasts are for looking at and that is why we do it. Don't try to</p>
<p>change that.</p>
<p>1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it</p>
<p>down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining</p>
<p>about you leaving it down.</p>
<p>1. Saturday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the</p>
<p>tides. Let it be.</p>
<p>1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it</p>
<p>that way.</p>
<p>1. Crying is blackmail.</p>
<p>1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do</p>
<p>not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say</p>
<p>it!</p>
<p>1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.</p>
<p>1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's</p>
<p>what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.</p>
<p>1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.</p>
<p>1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In</p>
<p>fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.</p>
<p>1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.</p>
<p>1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways</p>
<p>makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.</p>
<p>1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it</p>
<p>done. Not both._ If you already know best how to do it, just do it</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during</p>
<p>commercials.</p>
<p>1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.</p>
<p>1. ALL men see in only 16 colours, like Windows default settings. Peach,</p>
<p>for example, is a fruit, not a colour. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have</p>
<p>no idea what mauve is.</p>
<p>1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.</p>
<p>1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like</p>
<p>nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the</p>
<p>hassle.</p>
<p>1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer</p>
<p>you don't want to hear.</p>
<p>1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to</p>
<p>discuss such topics as Sex, Sport, or Cars.</p>
<p>1. You have enough clothes.</p>
<p>1. You have too many shoes.</p>
<p>1. I am in shape. Round is a shape.</p>
<p>1. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch</p>
<p>tonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like camping.</p>
