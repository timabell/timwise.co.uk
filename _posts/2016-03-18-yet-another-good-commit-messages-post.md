Some guidance for writing better commit messages:  

*   this isn't a bad guide [https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/commit-messages/](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/commit-messages/)
*   mentions git but broadly useful: [https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)
*   [http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) more along similar lines (I'm not fussed about point 5), and wrapping is a git thing not a tfs thing.
*   A list of highlights of changes in bullets is often nice to add, makes it easier to spot the key changes in a large diff
*   Also remember your code and your commits can last a veeeeeery long time, and you never know what poor soul will have to understand what you did and why years later... [https://youtu.be/G45hqWNScvE](https://youtu.be/G45hqWNScvE)
