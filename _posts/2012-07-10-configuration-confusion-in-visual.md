Here's a gotcha that got me.  

It is not immediately obvious, but visual studio stores in it's sln file a set of project configuration selections for every combination of solution configuration and solution platform.  

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IZ7sKsaxFrc/T_w-r9usFUI/AAAAAAAAAGs/tjQwQOIVUnY/s320/visual-studio-platform-selection.PNG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IZ7sKsaxFrc/T_w-r9usFUI/AAAAAAAAAGs/tjQwQOIVUnY/s1600/visual-studio-platform-selection.PNG)</div>

The gotcha is that by default Visual Studio (all versions 2008-2012 as far as I know) only show one half of that combination in the standard toolbar, so you can get in a situation where one of your developers is building something completely different to everyone else as somehow the platform has silently been changed.  

I recommend you add Platform to your toolbar so that you can _always_ see what you are about to build.  

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oyMd-kmXi8E/T_w-sTwlSvI/AAAAAAAAAG0/5bx4-MMc84M/s320/visual-studio-platform-toolbar.PNG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oyMd-kmXi8E/T_w-sTwlSvI/AAAAAAAAAG0/5bx4-MMc84M/s1600/visual-studio-platform-toolbar.PNG)</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-syeHX6qxTrw/T_w-rTN45aI/AAAAAAAAAGo/jYrcbUis7gk/s320/visual-studio-platform-command.PNG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-syeHX6qxTrw/T_w-rTN45aI/AAAAAAAAAGo/jYrcbUis7gk/s1600/visual-studio-platform-command.PNG)</div>

And if possible, remove any unused platform configurations from your solution entirely.
