<p>SBR = Swim, Bike, Run. It's a triathlon thing.</p>
<p>On monday, I biked to work as per, very unstrenuous. Then I went training in the evening. Went for a proper training run, which I was just jogging back from when the heaveans opened and I got soaked. The water then turned to slush, like being sprayed with a slush puppy.</p>
<p>Then I swam, very very slowwwly (urgh, gurgle).</p>
<p>Spent tuesday moaning about how much my legs hurt and how tired I was. It's good to be a brit.</p>
<p>Today I woke up with a start thinking I'd slept through my alarm. But it was half an hour too early. Must've got enough sleep for once.</p>
