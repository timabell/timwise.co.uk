<p>Glad that's over.<br>I've moved now. And am still super busy. Life is good though.<br>Left office at 10.30 last night having repatched the network. Then I cleaned the fridge and fixed a few cupboards!<br>Today I have been mostly driving a W-Reg Fiat Uno, which is amusing. (My car failed MOT on its horn.)</p>
<p>Merry xmas one and all, and as Kev said, hope to see you at new year. I think we're having curry in the office today to celebrate, which I'm looking forward to.</p>
