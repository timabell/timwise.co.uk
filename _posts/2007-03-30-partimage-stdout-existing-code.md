On first inspection it looks like some code already exists for writing an image to stdout (standard output).<br /><br /><a href="http://partimage.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/partimage/trunk/partimage/src/shared/image_disk.cpp?revision=1&view=markup&pathrev=20#l_558">image_disk.cpp, line 558</a><br /><pre><code>  if (strcmp(m_szImageFilename, "stdout"))<br />    {<br />      //... network output code hidden for clarity ...<br />    }<br />  else // it's stdout<br />    {<br />      m_fImageFile = stdout;<br />      showDebug(1, "image will be on stdout\n");<br />    }<br /></code></pre><br />Unlike stdin for restore, stdout for save is not currently available in the command line options. I did do a build earlier where I enabled it (which I don't have any more due to my build problems). I managed to pipe an image to hexdump and seemed to be able to see some of the user interface info in the output.<br /><br />It would seem the problem with the stdout option is that even in batch mode the program outputs interface data to stdout, which then corrupts the image. <br /><br />I think I shall attempt to remove all the UI stuff, and make it act more like all the other unix tools. Might also try to create a reusable library out of it.
