I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Journey-Software-Professional-Sociology-Programming/dp/0132366134">Journey of the Software Professional: Sociology of Computer Programming</a>. It's proved so far to be a unique insight into how developers go from seeing a problem to providing a solution, good or bad. It's quite hard going as there's a lot of detailed analysis into how we work, but it's certainly given me food for thought.<br /><br />In another area of self improvement, I recently passed <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/Exam.aspx?ID=70-536&amp;Locale=en-us">70-536: TS: Microsoft .NET Framework - Application Development Foundation</a>, and am currently reading up on the ASP.NET exam with a view to gaining the MCTS cert. Much as I had hoped I'd left exams behind years ago, it is proving to be a useful exercise in filling in the gaps in my knowledge. Today I finally got around to creating something with Web Parts, which I wouldn't otherwise have done, another plan filed away in my cognitive library (cf. Journey of the Software Professional).
