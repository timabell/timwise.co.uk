<p>If you follow my ramblings you might know that I've revived my interest in creating a commercial tool to help devs, dbas etc browse their sql databases. I've done some research before and didn't find much on a par with what I have in mind. I've done a bit more, and turned up a couple:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sql-workbench.net/fk_lookup_png.html">A feature of sql workbench</a> - I've seen the product but didn't know it could do that. Not directly competition as it's not nearly as smooth to use as what I'm building for this particular use case.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlsmash.com/index.html">SqlSmash</a> - Something I'd not seen before, which has <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0kdqcrYHdo?t=1m14s">fk based navigation (vid)</a> that's basically what I'm building, albeit embedded in SSMS rather than standalone.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't the first time I've had the experience of getting started before discovering another product that basically solves the problem I'm gunning for. (<a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/readyroll/">Ready-roll</a> was the last, since bought by red-gate).</p>
<p>Now it's not that I thought my idea was magic or special or a unique little flower, but why is it after working with SQL Server databases for 15 years that I've only just noticed this tool (which I would have found useful and probably would have paid for).</p>
<p>If I created another would it be just as obscure? Should I still go ahead even though it's a solved problem? Are there any ideas left on the earth?</p>
<p>Something for me to consider this week. I might update this post with further thoughts. Your thoughts are welcome.</p>
