> ... Even a one hour task might change to an eight hour task (or multiple tasks..) due to new information found out during that one hour that was the original estimate. The key point is not to focus on how many hours the team got done on the task, but how many hours really are remaining. The daily update should never be: "I worked on that for four hours, so you can take four hours out of the estimate", but rather a real estimate on how much work still needs to be done based on current knowledge.
