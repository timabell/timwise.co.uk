I've had my first ever patch to an open source project accepted! Yay! (Fanfare please... no? anyone? oh well.)<br /><br />Ok it's a one word change to a piece of documentation, but hey it's still something.<br /><br />The project is <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">gnucash</a>. For details take a look at <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=490699">the bug report</a> I created to hold the patch. I even got a thanks :-).
