<p>apologies to anyone who had noticed <a href="http://timwise.dyndns.org/awstats/awstats.pl?config=timwise&amp;configdir=/etc/awstats">my stats</a> have been offline since sep 24th.</p>
<p>I had a power failure which upset my linux server / knackered old laptop (no battery!), I had to <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/docs/awstats_faq.html#OLDLOG">manually update</a> the entrys for all missed days and have only just got round to it. Should be ok now.</p>
<p>In other news, Kev has promised as a journal, further to putting <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/andy.brook55/kev/">some photos</a>. online - good work mr kev. (note at bottom of pic pages a credit to me<nobr> </nobr>:)<br>Also Andy has an <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/andy.brook55/">website</a> which is worth a look, check out the uni dessertation.</p>
<p>xx</p>
