<p>I didn't think this kind of thing still existed, let alone on a commercial site:<br><a href="https://www.mytravelmoney.com/SiteBrowser.htm">https://www.mytravelmoney.com/SiteBrowser.htm</a></p>
<p>So I sent them a rant<nobr> </nobr>:)</p>
<p>---------------<br>To: webmaster@mytravelmoney.com; webmaster@goingplaces.co.uk</p>
<p><a href="http://www.goingplaces.co.uk/AniteNextPage.asp?p=HOLIDAYEXTRASHOME&amp;s=162000990">http://www.goingplaces.co.uk/AniteNextPage.asp?p=HOLIDAYEXTRASHOME&amp;s=162000990</a><br><a href="https://www.mytravelmoney.com/SiteBrowser.htm">https://www.mytravelmoney.com/SiteBrowser.htm</a></p>
<p>From your site:</p>
<p>
        "The view this site you must use Internet Explorer 5.0 or later.</p>
<p>
        You may download the latest version of Internet Explorer from the following URL:</p>
<p>
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads</a>"</p>
<p>This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Haven't you heard of Firefox, Opera, Netscape, Mozilla, Lynx, Safari? Or Linux? Or Macs? Or the W3C and the drive for standards? This kind of message makes your site look like it's stuck in the 80's. If you cannot design a site for more than one browser then you shouldn't be designing websites.<br>In case you hadn't guessed, I won't now be buying currency from you.</p>
