<p>Gosh I really was annoyed on sunday!</p>
<p>Having said all that, buy my stuff on eBay (again)!<br>I'll figure out an alternative another day, but it's gonna be tricky when eBay have market share and a fat advertising budget.<br>Never trust a company with a large advertising budget, they tend to discover advertising budget has a better ROI than investing in the product, motivating staff, providing customer support etc etc.</p>
<p>In other news, the new iRiver H10 looks nice but appears to be missing all of the advatages of the older H300. Damn. Thought it was about to kick iPod's shiny backside.</p>
