So here's how to log in from the gdm "face browser" with a single click.  
Instructions tested with Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron and 8.10 Intrepid Ibex.  
  
  
as root, create a new file containing the usernames of all the users you want be able to log in through gdm without entering a password:  
`  
sudo -i  
echo 'username' >> /etc/gdm/nopassusers  
`  
now still as root modify the pam settings for gdm to check this file and allow this user in based on being in the list:  
vi  /etc/pam.d/gdm  
`  
vi /etc/pam.d/gdm  
`  
and modify to contain the new listfile item  
`  
#%PAM-1.0  
auth requisite pam_nologin.so  
auth required pam_env.so readenv=1  
auth required pam_env.so readenv=1 envfile=/etc/default/locale  
**auth sufficient pam_listfile.so item=user sense=allow file=/etc/gdm/nopassusers onerr=fail** #add this line  
@include common-auth  
auth optional pam_gnome_keyring.so  
@include common-account  
session required pam_limits.so  
@include common-session  
session optional pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start  
@include common-password  
`  
now simply restart gdm (or the whole machine) and try your new one-click login  
`  
/etc/init.d/gdm restart  
`  
  
  
Notes:  
This means the keyring isn't unlocked, so you may have to type in your password anyway before your wireless connects.
