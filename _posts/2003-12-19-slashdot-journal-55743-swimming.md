<p>Didn't remember to write entry on Thur as had manic morning at work (what's new?) then xmas drinks in the afternoon (and we won't talk about the evening other than saying I regret it... urrrgh).<br>In other news, I made it into the pool in time for 35 mins swimming and managed 22 lengths I think. Including two not very successful attempts at a front crawl / breathing water.</p>
<p>Irrelevantly: I just got vnc viewer working on my P800 and can actually see these words in this form on it. Woo! Cool, but not useful (sorry Negi).</p>
