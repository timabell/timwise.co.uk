<p>Was going to write yesterday but things have been on code "aaaaaarrr" lately due to absence of J.</p>
<p>Exercise this week: nil (apart from commutating)<br>Beer this week: (b)(b)(b)(b)(b)(b)(b)(b)(b)</p>
<p>I was going to say that I'd nearly succeeded in booting a computer into linux from a usb key memory device, using <a href="http://rz-obrian.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/knoppix-usb/">this</a> reference. And damn small linux as stated, which I already knew about.</p>
<p>Struggling to recompile the kernel image on my SuSE 9 box.<br>Why do it? Because I should be able to. And it's satisfying. Who needs sleep anyway?</p>
