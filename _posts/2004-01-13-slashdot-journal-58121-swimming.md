<p>1km, I did it! 40 lengths. In 50 mins. Must've been the new trunks that did it, so much more comfortable, and so much less hastle, even if they  are slightly embarrasing.<br>I did drive in mind. But I shall still be on my bike to work, just had to come back here in between to get the car picked up.</p>
<p>I am sooo tired. I've been "helping" the local drama bunch lately, so I was out till late last night again, then I had to go to Asda coz my cupboards were bear. Not without going to the pub first of course!</p>
