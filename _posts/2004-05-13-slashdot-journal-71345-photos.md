<p>A friend just put me on to a rather nifty image hosting service called <a href="http://www.photobucket.com/">Photo bucket</a>.<br>I got a registration to have a look round. You can see what I get up to on <a href="http://img66.photobucket.com/albums/v202/tim_abell/">my album</a> page. The service resizes images for you which is handy for the non technically minded of us.</p>
<p>Not that I need it given that I pay for web space.</p>
