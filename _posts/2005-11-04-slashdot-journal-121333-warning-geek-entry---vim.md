<p>I've got to grips with the basics of emacs/xemacs, so I thought it was time I got up to speed with this ubiquitous vi thing.</p>
<p>I found a tutorial on my linux box (courtesy of <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/">linuxquestions</a>). It's under and hour, and I feel like I understand how to do basic editing now.</p>
<p>Fire up your trusty linux box, switch to a console (ctrl+alt+f1), login, then type 'vimtutor'.</p>
<p>Super, ~800 lines of interactivity that will have you up in no time...</p>
