<ul> <li>their website is soooo slow.</li>
<li>You can't change a listing in the last  24hrs, but there's nothing to say so</li>
<li>You can't see anything before 60 days ago</li>
<li>You can't change your invoices if you make a mistake</li>
<li>they really stress me out every time i try to use their stupid website.</li>
<li>the whole thing is really counter intuitive</li>
<li>there is no competition, so they can be as shit as they want and people will still use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>/ unashamed rant</p>
<p>Ps I've had a shitty cold for the last few days.<br>Yes, I'm currently a bad mood bear. Did I mention I hate sundays too? Why does everything shut by the time I'm up? (4pm) If they've even bothered opening at all.</p>
<p>Someone find me a beer.</p>
<p>edit:<br>ok, having read this<br><a href="http://forums.ebay.com/db2/thread.jspa?threadID=2231811&amp;tstart=0&amp;mod=1114654773979">http://forums.ebay.com/db2/thread.jspa?threadID=2231811&amp;tstart=0&amp;mod=1114654773979</a><br>I'm never using ebay again. [expletive deleted].</p>
<p>by the way, the reason i'm so pissed is that they've charged me for two listings which I NEVER GOT PAYMENT FOR. [expletive deleted]</p>
