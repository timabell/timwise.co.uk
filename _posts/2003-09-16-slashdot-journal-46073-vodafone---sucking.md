<p>Sent a message to vodafone saying that I wasn't too impressed.<br>I know ranting gets you nowhere but I feel better nontheless.</p>
<p>The rant:<br>-------------------------------<br>I have been with vodafoam for about 2 months now and I am SERIOUSLY DISSILUSIONED with every aspect of your business.</p>
<p>Since I joined, you have failed to set up my direct debit, twice, blocked my outgoing calls, twice (including calls to 191, you morons!) - for no good reason. Been unable to answer the most basic questions over the phone, such as what has happened to the money I have sent you. And, been alternately "unable" and "too incompetent" to set up normal voicemail notification.</p>
<p>In addition, your website is one of the worst commercial sites I have seen in a long time. I have never seen a site before where your session expires without even being logged on. Appalling. As you may have guessed, I cannot view my bill online as promised because of you inability to set up a direct debit. And the point of that would be what?</p>
<p>I would normally expect at least some kind of apology and some remedial action, however your corporation appears to have its head so far up its own backside that it has no idea what it's like to be one of your customers. I shall look forward to your bland impersonal corporate excuse for a response.<br>--------------------------</p>
