<p>I like the gimp a lot, and have been trying out some <a href="http://www.flashgimp.com/tutorials/photoshop_tutorials.php">tutorials</a>. Then it started crashing whenever I created a new image! argh! So after a bit of searching and a pointer from a <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=317570">bug report</a> I tried replacing the GTK+ installation I had obtained with <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">gaim</a> with a new one from the gimp <a href="http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/">installer page</a>. One restart later, problem solved. I like open sauce. Closed source software companies don't tend to be keen on publishing problems, even when people have resolutions to offer.</p>
