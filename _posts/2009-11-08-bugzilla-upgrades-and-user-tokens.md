It's bugzilla upgrade time for my private install, and I have for the second time run into a strange issue with the tokens system. Since this is the second time and I know how to fix it, here it is for the record.  

I have upgrade from v3.0.4 to 3.4.3.  

Once the site was up again, saving the site parameters (editparams.cgi) showed a big red warning:  

> <div id="bugzilla-body">
> 
> <div class="throw_error">It looks like you didn't come from the right page (you have no valid token for the _edit_parameters_ action while processing the 'editparams.cgi' script). The reason could be one of:  
> 
> *   You clicked the "Back" button of your web browser after having successfully submitted changes, which is generally not a good idea (but harmless).
> *   You entered the URL in the address bar of your web browser directly, which should be safe.
> *   You clicked on a URL which redirected you here **without your consent**, in which case this action is much more critical.
> 
> Are you sure you want to commit these changes anyway? This may result in unexpected and undesired results.  
>   
> [Confirm Changes]  
> </div>
> 
> Or throw away these changes and go back to editparams.cgi.
> 
> </div>

Pushing the button doesn't work (same page shows again).  

After much digging last time I discovered that the tokens it refers to are stored in table bugs.tokens, and that the size of the field is wrong in my installation after the upgrade (again).  
`  
mysql> use bugs;  
mysql> describe tokens;  
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+  
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |  
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+  
| userid | mediumint(9) | YES | MUL | NULL | |  
| issuedate | datetime | NO | | NULL | |  
| <span style="font-weight: bold;">token | varchar(5)</span> | NO | PRI | NULL | |  
| tokentype | varchar(8) | YES | | NULL | |  
| eventdata | tinytext | YES | | NULL | |  
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+  
5 rows in set (0.02 sec)  
`  
According to the published schema, token should be varchar(16). [http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/p4dti/tool/cgi/bugzilla-schema/index.cgi?action=single&version=3.4.2&view=View+schema#table-tokens](http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/p4dti/tool/cgi/bugzilla-schema/index.cgi?action=single&version=3.4.2&view=View+schema#table-tokens)  

To fix the problem I modified the data type as follows:  

`  
mysql> alter table tokens modify column token varchar(16) not null;  
Query OK, 20 rows affected (0.32 sec)  
Records: 20 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0  
`  

And then I was able to change my parameters.
