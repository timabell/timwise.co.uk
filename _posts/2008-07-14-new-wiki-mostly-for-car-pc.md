Take a look at [http://timwise.wikispaces.com/](http://timwise.wikispaces.com/)  
  
I've started adding information about the car pc, and won't make any promises about what else I'll be adding (personal motto: under promise, over deliver).  
  
I've made it open to all editors, and licensed under the GNU Free documentation licence to ensure the maximum value, reach and participation.
