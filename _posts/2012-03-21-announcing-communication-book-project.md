[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pMoDVHCIh24/T2pDE3IeGxI/AAAAAAAAAEM/dKiGFEIYC4U/s200/screenshot_v0.3-r34.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pMoDVHCIh24/T2pDE3IeGxI/AAAAAAAAAEM/dKiGFEIYC4U/s1600/screenshot_v0.3-r34.png)I've been working on a piece of open source software to assist people who have [aphasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia) (speech difficulties), and it is now sufficiently functional to be worth mentioning. It's still very rough around the edges, but if you are on a debian based system you should be able to easily get it up and running and see what you think. If you are on other platforms you'll currently need a bit (alright, a lot) of java knowledge to get this up and running.  

If you have the time to help I'd be very grateful. You don't have to be a coder, just letting me know if it works for you would be great.  

If you want to know more or would like to give it a try then please do head over to the project page at [http://launchpad.net/communication](http://launchpad.net/communication).
