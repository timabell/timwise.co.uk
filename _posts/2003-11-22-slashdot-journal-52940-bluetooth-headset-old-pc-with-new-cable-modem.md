<p>Hello my loyal fanbase. (of me reading my own journal - hello me).</p>
<p>Voice dialling seems to be working on my headset now. Woo. Still not sure it's acting quite how it should.</p>
<p>Fixed internet connection on my P800. Turned off secure thingy in the connection settings. All started working again. (Wonder if that's bad?)<br>Used about 1/4 Mb today, but thanks to fone tariff obfuscation I have no idea what that cost me.</p>
<p>the old pc....<br>A's got cable installed now. How do I download a firewall? I connect the unprotected pc to the internet! Aarggh. Stressful. Getting there now.<br>Should have brought my install disks with me. Never mind.</p>
<p>T.</p>
