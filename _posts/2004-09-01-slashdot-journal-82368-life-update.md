<p>it's late so I'll keep it short.<br>I went to greenbelt this weekend, which was fun. Good music, great music, some terrible music. A bearable dose of religion, and quite a nice element of generic spirituality. Plenty of rain outside the tent but I didn't get very wet except when I flew my kite.</p>
<p>Dropped in to london town last night to see some old friends and had a great evening. Don't think there's anything I can relay here though!</p>
<p>urgh. bed.</p>
<p>did I mention I'm now running an apache webserver on Mandrake Linux? I did? Oh well, never mind then.</p>
