I did this in one take with no post-production work. I figure practice will improve my selection and delivery of the content. Behind the scenes I used the following: ## Hardware \* Dell XPS 13 - (9350 model), using the built-in webcam (up-nose view, camera in bottom left of lid for some reason), good enough for tiny pic in corner. \* \[Snowball usb mic\](http://amzn.to/2FGWsQQ) (great sound quality, no worrying about analogue stuff), sat on a folded towel on my desk to deaden vibrations through the mini-tripod. The snowball has 3 settings on a switch at the back, had it on 3 - omni directional, I tested \[all three modes\](https://youtu.be/-3rbPaJgTWA?t=1m59s) beforehand. \* Supplied stand didn't actually fit properly, so bought an \[ammoon mini tripod\](http://amzn.to/2pkYEmg) instead which is lovely (importantly it has the right screw thread for the mic). \* A quiet room after everyone is in bed to avoid \[interruptions\](https://youtu.be/Mh4f9AYRCZY), and did the recording between rain storms! ## Software \* \[Linux Mint\](https://linuxmint.com/) 18.3 Cinnamon \* \[Vokoscreen\](http://linuxecke.volkoh.de/vokoscreen/vokoscreen.html) 2.4.0 - this handles screen recording & the picture-in-picture from the webcam I recorded the entire screen at 1920x1080 (seeing as even phones are HD now). and uploaded it to youtube. (drag-n-drop, simplez!) ## Settings Control panel > sound > input > snowball > about 130% input volume !\[Sound\_183.png\]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sound\_183.png) fullscreen capture, display 2, 1920x1080 !\[Screenshot from 2018-03-17 18-27-39.png\]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot-from-2018-03-17-18-27-39.png) pulse / blue-snowball selected !\[Screenshot from 2018-03-17 18-27-55.png\]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot-from-2018-03-17-18-27-55.png) mpeg4, mp3, avi, 25fps !\[vokoscreen 2.4.0\_180\]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vokoscreen-2-4-0\_180.png) Default config apart from save path "videopath" !\[vokoscreen 2.4.0\_181.png\]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vokoscreen-2-4-0\_181.png) Webcam switched on !\[vokoscreen 2.4.0\_182.png\]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vokoscreen-2-4-0\_182.png) ## Other attempts I spent ages finding the right software and doing test takes to get sound levels etc right. I started off with Kazaam for recording and mplayer for the webcam onscreen video. I got mplayer to show a borderless webcam video picture on screen that I could then use with any screen recorder, but had problems with dual screen behaviour so even though I could zoom in better I gave up on that once I'd discovered vokoscreen. You might also want to look at \[https://wistia.com/soapbox\](https://wistia.com/soapbox) which I hear is very good.
