<p>urgh. I'm up already, going swimming today.<br>I'm going to have to start running soon, not looking forward to that at all.<br>I've heard that Ellen has sorted herself out and is about to get married. Go girl!<br>Smoking is a filthy habit and it's starting to annoy me when people smoke in my space, guess I'd better go find my slippers and look after that comb-over.<br>Right. I'm off to shower.<br>xx<br>Tim</p>
