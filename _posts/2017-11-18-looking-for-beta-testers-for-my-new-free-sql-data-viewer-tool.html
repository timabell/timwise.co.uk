<p>Hi, my name's Tim and I'm a UK based developer trying to build my first startup.  I'm working on a data-browsing tool for Sql Server etc. that I really believe can help people do their jobs.</p>
<p>I'm reaching out to the online communities to try and find people who will find it useful and who are prepared to help me shape the early product.</p>
<p>Please take a look at my offering on <a href="https://sqldataviewer.com/">https://sqldataviewer.com/</a> ... and if you like the look of it then please sign up to my <a href="https://www.getdrip.com/forms/70504364/submissions/new">waiting list</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your precious time!</p>
