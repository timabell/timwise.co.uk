<p>having worked another six day week, I discover that I now can't do anything I had to do on my day off. Namely involving post office for ebay (shut), barclays for a new account (shut) and registering at the health centre (open 9-5 mon-fri, which is no frickin good at all). piss. guess I'll just go buy shoes at the oracle cos that's all that's open. maybe I'll try to move my hours to work sunday. not.</p>
