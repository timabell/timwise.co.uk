<p>Just made dinner. Fish fingers, left over roast spuds, veggie gravy granules, yummy. Candle lit dinner for one! But that's ok, cos life isn't that bad, been out for a ride, lovely windy weather down on the lake. Was hoping to get out on a windsurfer, no chance. Have to be this weekend.</p>
<p>And I have new whiteboard which is cool.<br>Pic: <a href="http://www.timwise.co.uk/images/141_4136.JPG">http://www.timwise.co.uk/images/141_4136.JPG</a></p>
