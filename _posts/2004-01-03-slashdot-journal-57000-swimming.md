<p>Got up this morning and cycled to the pool. Swam 20 lengths (I think) in about 40 mins, at which point some french fish like people turned up and put me to shame. The mum dived in one end and covered half the length of the pool before even taking a stroke (or surfacing) then covered the rest in what seemed like three strokes. Bet she had no idea how hard it is for me to cover that distance.</p>
<p>Maybe I need lessons. I spotted a Reading Swimming Club bag in the changing rooms which is a bit of a clue.</p>
<p>Then I cycled back via the bike shop, which wasn't even open yet, so my gear changer is still bust. Though I did discover the <a href="http://www.slimsmith.com/rcc/home.html">reading cycling bunch</a> have a stand in Reading market on the first Saturday of the month, which is today I think.</p>
