<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>Success of the week (Mon eve):<br>Swimming 400m in (more or less) one attempt.<br>Time taken: 12mins<br>Lengths: 16.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>Also, for all who didn't know I was the butler (and no, I didn't do it; yawn), I very much enjoyed my stage debut.</p>
<p>I even got recognised in the chinese on sat night by a young lady who had seen the friday night show - joy.</p>
