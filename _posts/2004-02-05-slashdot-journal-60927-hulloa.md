<p>Gosh, it's 7 days since i wrote here.<br>I'm back to my nocturnal ways - such is the way of the geek.</p>
<p>I've joined our friendly local <a href="http://www.thamesvalleytri.f9.co.uk/">triathletes</a>, who have been teaching me to "swim", I can nearly front crawl now. This is why I've given up logging my distances for the moment, I need to get the technique sussed before I worry too  much about the fitness. Having said that I believe I managed 20+ lengths (25m) on wed eve in the hour's training, mostly in front crawl which was an achievement for me. (Bear in mind I only started swimming in Nov '03.</p>
<p>right, back to attempt 4 at suse linux</p>

<p>ps:<br>Coz beat me in oz:<br>42 lengths of 51.5 meters in 1.5 hours</p>
