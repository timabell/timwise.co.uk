Today I wanted to geo-code some of my photos.  

I have an SLR digital camera (no gps of course), and an android phone. I recorded a track with [My Tracks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.maps.mytracks) from google on the phone. (Not entirely recommended but works). I then fired up digikam to run the geo-correlation and add lat-long to the exif of the files only to discover [digikam doesn't know how to read kml](http://community.kde.org/Digikam/GSoC2010/ReverseGeocoding#TODO_Later_versions). Fooey.  

<div style="text-align: center;">[![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3756/12293521763_bfebeeaa41_n.jpg)](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/tim_abell/12293521763/) </div>

I looked to gpsbabel, but it apparently can't handle this style of kml file, as differentiated by the coordinates being in the following style of markup:  

`<gx:Track>  
<when>2014-01-25T18:00:13.955Z</when>  
<gx:coord>-1.885348 50.769434</gx:coord>  
<when>2014-01-25T18:00:14.565Z</when>  
<gx:coord>-1.885193 50.769328 53.20000076293945</gx:coord>  
<when>2014-01-25T18:00:58.566Z</when>`  

<div>  
So I wrote a python script to munge it into gpx shape:</div>

<div class="gistLoad" data-id="8791116" id="gist-GistID">[https://gist.github.com/timabell/8791116](https://gist.github.com/timabell/8791116)  

This can be run as follows:  

`./kmlToGpx.py "25-01 12-48.kml" > "25-01 12-48.kml.gpx"`  

And worked a treat for me.  

After I'd done this I discovered my pet tool [gpsprune](http://activityworkshop.net/software/gpsprune/index.html) can open the new style kml. (I [forked gpsprune](https://github.com/timabell/gpsprune) a while ago and added a minor feature) However I'm glad to have a command-line tool as I have hundreds of tracks I want to convert.  

Incidentally the phone can automatically sync the tracks to google drive, which is kinda handy and then you can download them from the site etc.
